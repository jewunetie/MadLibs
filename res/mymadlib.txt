My <family member> would always say to me whenever I come from <place>,
"If you don't have anything <adjective> to say, don't say it at all."
I never understood that saying until I was <number> years old.
I was talking to <proper noun> and they asked me if I <weird major>

years for me to be treated like this! I responded, "At least, I don't
look like <celebrity> had a baby with <animal>!" I instantly felt
<emotion> for saying that. I don't know what else to say so I
just <verb> out of there.
